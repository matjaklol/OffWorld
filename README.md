# OffWorld

This is the primary development branch for my indie game "OffWorld". Written in Java, it uses Processing 3.3.7 as the primary architecture with OpenGL as the rendering pipeline.

Based off of the original project (initially published to [Itch.io](https://matires.itch.io/offworld)) of the same name. Currently aiming to be an open 'world' sandbox exploration game.
